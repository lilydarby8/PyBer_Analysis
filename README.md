# PyBer Ride Sharing Analysis

## Overview 
   The purpose of the Pyber analysis was to provide V. Isualize with ride-sharing data by city type. In doing this it will equip them with each city type’s weekly fares and help the company make future decisions that will better improve the mission of V. Isualize in Urban, Suburban, and Rural areas.

## Pyber Analysis Results

-	V. Isualize does very well in the urban cities. The Urban cities are responsible for more than half of the company’s total fares. The pie graph shows that 62.7% of the total fares are from the Urban area. In Urban areas the 2,405 total drivers have given 1,625 rides to the people in those cities generating $39,845 in fares. Their average fare is $24.53 cents. 

-	The Suburban area is also doing well. Considering there are less people than the Urban cities, and things are a bit more spread out they make up 30.5% of total fares. They have less drivers than the total rides. It seems the demand is higher than the driver capacity. In suburban areas the 490 total drivers have given 625 rides to the people in their cities generating $19,356 in total fares. Their average fare is $30.97 cents.


-	The Rural area lacks drivers and consumers. In rural areas things are more spaced out in comparison to the Urban and Suburban cities. With things being more spaced out the fare increases due to increased milage. With that and the lack of drivers means the people who do partake in ride-sharing have to pay more than the other two city types. Due to the sparsity of the drivers, they are less likely to get picked up. The Rural cities make up 6.8% of the total fares. In Rural areas the 78 total drivers have given 125 rides to the people in their cities generating $4,327 in total fares. Their average fare is $34,62 cents. 

## Pyber summary
V. Isualize does very well in the Urban cities. There are more drivers than there are consumers. I think this helps the ride-sharing thrive compared to the Suburban and Rural areas because the consumers are guaranteed to be picked up because the ratio of consumers to drivers. In the "PyBer Ride-Sharing Data (2019)" graph it shows that the more drivers there are the more rides are given. I suggest that V. Isualize hire more drivers for the Suburban and Rural areas so that they can not only keep up with the demand of people partaking in ride-sharing, but also increase the amount of people who use ride-sharing. ![This is an image](https://github.com/lilydarby8/PyBer_Analysis/issues/1#issue-1308227900)
To address the issue of why some consumers may be opting out of using ride-sharing due to their increased fare and lack of drivers, I suggest a reward program of those who do use ride-sharing. They can get points for referring others to use ride-sharing and accumulate points the more they use ride-sharing. The points will take a certain amount of money from their total fare.
To get drivers to the Suburban and Rural areas quickly I suggest V. Isualize send 100 drivers from the Urban cities a proposition for an increased wage if they travel to the Suburban and Rural areas to help the demand for rides. In doing this, the Suburban and Rural areas will get drivers in no time.
